                        Malaria is a disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to humans
                         through the bites of infected mosquitoes.</br> Common signs include fever, chills, 
                         headache, and flu-like symptoms.

                            <p3> Mosquitoes are the primary carriers of the malaria parasites. </br>They bite and can spread
                                 the disease to people, especially in areas where malaria is common. </p3>

                            <p3>When people do not use insecticide-treated mosquito nets, they are at a higher risk of malaria. </br>
                                 Mosquitoes can carry the parasites that </br>
                                 cause the disease, and without protection, individuals are more likely to be bitten while sleeping. </p3>

                                 illness.</br> Preventing malaria can reduce these costs significantly. </p3>
